# Python Skills Check — Slides 61–116
# CONDITIONALS & FUNCTIONS — CHALLENGE VERSION
# ============================================================

# DIRECTIONS
# ============================================================
# - I recommend you create a repo first and clone it.
# - Drag this file into your repo and push when you are done.
#
# Complete each task underneath its directions.
#
# RULES:
# - Use ONLY concepts we have learned in class.
# - Use the EXACT variable and function names provided.
# - Do not delete the directions.
# - Your entire Python file must run without errors.
# - Do NOT manually type an answer that Python should determine.
# - Pay attention to indentation.
# - Read carefully. MANY questions are intentionally tricky.
# - Unless a task says otherwise, do NOT use min() or max().
# - Your conditions should work even if the variable values are changed.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Some questions are designed so that the ORDER of your conditions matters.
# Some questions have edge cases such as ties or boundary values.
# Test your logic carefully.
