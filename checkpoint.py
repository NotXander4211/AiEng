# Python Skills Check — LISTS & LOOPS
# CHALLENGE VERSION — 40 TASKS
# ============================================================
# DIRECTIONS:
# - Create a repository, clone it, and add this file.
# - Complete each task UNDER its directions.
# - Do not delete the directions.
# - Use ONLY concepts learned in class, except for 'in' and 'not in'.
#   You must research these two new operators independently in Section 5.
# - Use the EXACT variable and function names provided.
# - The entire file must run without errors.
# - Do not hard-code results Python should calculate.
# - Unless a task says otherwise, do NOT use sum(), min(), max(),
#   sorted(), sort(), list comprehensions, sets, or dictionaries.
# - For functions, RETURN values when instructed; do not just print.
# - Test edge cases and change the starting values to check your logic.
# - Tasks that ask for input() may be tested individually.

# ============================================================
# SECTION 5 — IN / NOT IN (TASKS 25–30)
# ============================================================
# INDEPENDENT RESEARCH REQUIRED:
# We have NOT covered 'in' and 'not in' in class. Before starting
# Tasks 25–30, research both operators on your own using reliable
# Python learning resources or the official Python documentation.
# Learn what each operator does, how it works with lists, and how
# to use it inside if statements and while loops.
# Write a short comment in your code explaining the difference
# between 'in' and 'not in' in your own words.
# The examples below are starting hints, NOT a substitute for research.
#
# NEW CONCEPT:
# 'in' checks whether a value is in a list.
# Example: "apple" in ["apple", "banana"] evaluates to True.
# 'not in' checks whether a value is missing.
# Example: "grape" not in ["apple", "banana"] evaluates to True.
# These expressions are useful in if statements and while loops.

# TASK 25:
# Create foods = ["pizza", "burger", "tacos", "sushi", "pasta"].
# Ask the user to enter a food.
# Use 'in' to print "Available" or "Not available".
